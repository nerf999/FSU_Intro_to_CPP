# FSU_Intro_to_CPP
Beginner C++ Projects – COP 3363 (Fall 2022)
This folder contains a series of beginner-level C++ programs developed as part of the COP 3363 (Intro to C++) course at Florida State University. Each project emphasizes core programming concepts such as input/output, arithmetic, conditional logic, and basic algorithms. These assignments were completed during Fall 2022.

List of Programs
1. program1.cpp – Walking Distance Calculator
Description: Calculates the total round-trip walking distance (in miles) between a hotel and two tourist attractions based on distances measured from a map in inches.

Concepts: Constants, floating-point math, output formatting, basic arithmetic.

2. alton_JMA20_p2.cpp – Cable Bill Calculator
Description: Computes the monthly bill for cable TV services based on the selected package (A, B, or C) and the number of hours watched. Also suggests cheaper packages when applicable.

Concepts: Conditionals, user input validation, simple decision logic.

3. alton_JMA20p3.cpp – Loan Payment Calculator
Description: Calculates monthly payments and total interest for a car loan based on user input for loan amount, interest rate, and payment duration.

Concepts: Looping, modular arithmetic, precision formatting, financial math.

4. alton_JMA20_p4.cpp – Student Gradebook
Description: Accepts multiple students' names and numeric grades, calculates the class average, and identifies the highest grade.

Concepts: File I/O (ifstream), arrays, loops, average computation.

5. alton_JMA20_p5.cpp – Toll Booth Simulation
Description: Simulates the toll booth system, counting cars passing and total tolls collected. Supports both paying and non-paying vehicles.

Concepts: Classes, member functions, object-oriented basics.

6. alton_JMA20_p6.cpp – Student Record Class
Description: Demonstrates a simple class representing a student, with functions to calculate GPA and display student information.

Concepts: Classes, constructors, encapsulation, arrays, data abstraction.

How to Compile
Use g++ to compile any of the programs. For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -o program1 program1.cpp
./program1
Each .cpp file is a standalone program and does not depend on any external libraries or files beyond the C++ standard library.

Notes
These programs reflect early-stage C++ syntax and programming style.

They were written with educational intent and may contain some logical redundancies or stylistic inconsistencies typical of introductory coursework.
early projects required that we use primitive types and no functions or classes.
