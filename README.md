# FSU_Intro_to_CPP
Beginner C++ Projects – COP 3363 (Fall 2022)
This folder contains a series of beginner-level C++ programs developed as part of the COP 3363 (Intro to C++) course at Florida State University. Each project emphasizes core programming concepts such as input/output, arithmetic, conditional logic, and basic algorithms. These assignments were completed during Fall 2022.

List of Programs
1. program1.cpp – Walking Distance Calculator
Description: Calculates the total round-trip walking distance (in miles) between a hotel and two tourist attractions based on distances measured from a map in inches.

Concepts: Constants, floating-point math, output formatting, basic arithmetic.

2. alton_JMA20_p2.cpp – Cable Bill Calculator
Description: Computes the monthly bill for cable TV services based on the selected package (A, B, or C) and the number of hours watched. Also suggests cheaper packages when applicable.

Concepts: Conditionals, user input validation, simple decision logic.

3. alton_JMA20p3.cpp – Tractor Beam Calculator
Description: Calculates if a space ship being dragged down to a planet is able to escape based on how much fuel it has and the strength of the beam

Concepts: Looping, modular arithmetic, precision formatting.

4. alton_JMA20_p4.cpp – Guessing Game
Description: Lets the user guess a number between 1 and 100 while betting money and earning winnings.

Concepts: functions, loops, math.

5. alton_JMA20_p5.cpp – Decoder
Description: decodes a message using either a substitution cypher or a Caeser Cypher. The Program will then decode a file using the given cypher.

Concepts: Strings, string manipulation
   

6. alton_JMA20_p6.cpp – Password System 
Description: Demonstrates a back end Password system with pin

Concepts: Functions, arrays, string manipulation.

How to Compile
Use g++ to compile any of the programs. For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -o program1 program1.cpp
./program1
Each .cpp file is a standalone program and does not depend on any external libraries or files beyond the C++ standard library.

Notes
These programs reflect early-stage C++ syntax and programming style.

They were written with educational intent and may contain some logical redundancies or stylistic inconsistencies typical of introductory coursework.
early projects required that we use primitive types and no functions or classes.
