/* PROGRAM Walking Distance Calculator
   AUTHOR: John Alton>
   COP 3363 - Fall 2022
   PROJECT NUMBER: 1 
   DUE DATE: Thursday 9/8/2022
   PLATFORM: g++ / UNIX OS

SUMMARY

A visitor to a city plans to go to two tourist attractions in one day, starting
at a hotel and returning to the hotel at the end of the day.  The visitor has a
map showing where all of these places are located, and wants to determine how
far apart they are and how far a person would have to walk in one day (round
trip) to see both tourist attractions.  One inch on the map equals one quarter 
mile on the ground.

INPUT

Three distances, as measured from the map by the user, in inches.  The user is
asked to enter values only to the nearest tenth of an inch.
- first distance is distance from hotel to first tourist attraction
- second distance is distance from first tourist attraction to second attraction
- third distance is from second attraction back to hotel

OUTPUT

The distance, in miles, between each of the places and the total distance, all
rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile.

ASSUMPTIONS

All input data is valid and correctly entered by the user.  
The visitor has measured the distances on the map using a ruler, in inches.
All distance values in miles are to be rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile.
